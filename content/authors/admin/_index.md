Robbie Emmet is a PhD student studying quantitative ecology at the University of Washington. His research involves developing statistical models of wildlife distribution, abundance, and survival to monitor highly mobile species. When he is not doing research, he often writes poetry, particularly nature and/or formal poetry (or semi-formal; his poetry is formal the way flannel is formal).
